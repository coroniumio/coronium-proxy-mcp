## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- ✅ **Real-time status verification**: Proxies now show accurate online/offline status
  - Checks actual modem state from rotation service, not cached API data
  - Adds "(verified)" label when real-time check succeeds
  - Prevents confusion from stale API status
- 🔗 **Rotation URLs**: Display direct links for modem restart and status checking
  - Restart URL for manual modem rotation
  - Status URL for real-time modem status checks
  - Rotation token included for API integration

### Security
- 🔒 **Domain hiding**: Rotation service domain is now hidden in output for security
  - URLs display as `https://[rotation-service]/...` instead of revealing actual domain
  - Prevents exposure of internal rotation infrastructure
- 🧹 **Simplified configuration**: Removed optional environment variables
  - Removed `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (auto-generated by default)
  - Removed `LOG_LEVEL` (sensible default provided)
  - Reduces user confusion and setup complexity

### Changed
- 📚 **Enhanced documentation**: Updated README with new output format examples
- 🔄 **Improved proxy display**: Better formatting with rotation tokens and URLs
- 📝 **Cleaner .env.example**: Simplified to only required credentials

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Status accuracy**: Fixed issue where modems showed offline despite being functional
  - API's cached status could be stale after rotation
  - Now validates with real-time external check
  - Customers see correct modem state immediately
